  <span class="chinese">读万卷书，行万里路。</span> Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for <span id="hiking-trigger">hiking</span>, having explored over 1,000 km of trails. I also appreciate deep reading across topics like <span id="social-sciences-trigger">social sciences</span>, <span id="history-trigger">history</span>, and <span id="psychology-trigger">psychology</span>.

  Aesthetically, I am drawn to Mies van der Rohe's <span id="seagram-trigger">"Less is More"</span>, and musically, I enjoy both Bach and Gould, especially the <span id="goldberg-trigger">Goldberg Variations</span>. Feel free to reach out to me!
